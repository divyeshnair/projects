“The Ashwariders” team manufactured an All Terrain Vehicle for the competition Baja Sae India. The project was developed to acquire data from the vehicle during 
the testing phase of the vehicle. The data was collected from rpm sensors, HC–sr04 sensor and then processed for further calculations.

The hardware used for the collecting the data was Arduino and the sensors like rpm sensors were integrated to the arduino.The arduino reads the data and this data 
is read by the python GUI which was developed using python-kivy framework.This gui would project the live readings when the arduino reads the data and when the 
whole live data streaming is over,the data is stored in an excel sheet.

The folder has following sub folders i.e 

1. ScreenShots - The folder has images and video of the software designed.
